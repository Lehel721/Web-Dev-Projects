## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Copilot Not Working

#### Issue: No suggestions appearing

**Solutions:**
1. Check the status bar icon:
   - Click the Copilot icon (bottom right)
   - Ensure it's not disabled or showing errors

2. Verify your subscription:
   - Go to [https://github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
   - Check that your subscription is active

3. Sign out and sign back in:
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Type "GitHub Copilot: Sign Out"
   - Then "GitHub Copilot: Sign In"

4. Restart VS Code:
   - Close all VS Code windows
   - Reopen the project

#### Issue: "Copilot not available in this file"

**Solutions:**
- Check file extension (Copilot works with `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.py`, etc.)
- Ensure the file is saved (not an untitled file)
- Check if the file type is supported in settings

#### Issue: Network/Connection errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Check firewall settings:
   - Copilot needs to communicate with GitHub servers
   - Ensure ports 443 and 80 are not blocked

3. If behind a corporate proxy:
   - Configure VS Code proxy settings
   - Go to Settings > Search "proxy"
   - Set `http.proxy` and `http.proxyStrictSSL`

#### Issue: Extension not installed

**Solutions:**
1. Check Extensions panel for errors
2. Try uninstalling and reinstalling:
   - Right-click on GitHub Copilot extension
   - Select "Uninstall"
   - Reload VS Code
   - Reinstall from Extensions marketplace

### Checking Logs

If problems persist:
1. Open Output panel: `View > Output` (or `Ctrl+Shift+U`)
2. Select "GitHub Copilot" from the dropdown
3. Look for error messages
4. Copy relevant errors when reporting issues

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Copilot subscription not found" | Verify subscription at github.com/settings/copilot |
| "Authentication failed" | Sign out and sign back in |
| "Network request failed" | Check internet connection and proxy settings |
| "Extension host terminated" | Restart VS Code, check for extension conflicts |

## Tips and Tricks

### Using Copilot Effectively

1. **Start with comments**: Write a comment describing what you want, then let Copilot suggest code
   ```javascript
   // Function to convert currency from USD to EUR
   ```

2. **Use descriptive names**: Better names lead to better suggestions
   ```javascript
   function calculateDiscountedPrice(price, discountPercentage) {
     // Copilot will suggest accurate implementation
   ```

3. **Accept/Reject suggestions**:
   - `Tab` - Accept suggestion
   - `Esc` - Reject suggestion
   - `Alt+]` - Next suggestion
   - `Alt+[` - Previous suggestion

4. **Partial acceptance**:
   - `Ctrl+â†’` - Accept next word
   - Use when you want part of the suggestion

### Using Copilot Chat

Open Copilot Chat:
- Click the chat icon in the sidebar
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`

Useful chat prompts:
- "Explain this code" (select code first)
- "Fix this bug" (describe the issue)
- "Add error handling to this function"
- "Make this code more efficient"
- "Add comments to explain this code"
- "Convert this callback to async/await"

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Toggle Copilot | `Ctrl+Alt+]` | `Cmd+Opt+]` |
| Open Chat | `Ctrl+Shift+I` | `Cmd+Shift+I` |
| Accept Suggestion | `Tab` | `Tab` |
| Reject Suggestion | `Esc` | `Esc` |
| Next Suggestion | `Alt+]` | `Opt+]` |
| Previous Suggestion | `Alt+[` | `Opt+[` |

### Live Server Tips

1. **Start server**:
   - Right-click `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"

2. **Stop server**:
   - Click "Port: 5500" in status bar
   - Or right-click and select "Stop Live Server"

3. **Change port** (if 5500 is in use):
   - Settings > Search "live server port"
   - Change to different port number

### Workspace Settings

The `.vscode/settings.json` file includes:
- Format on save enabled
